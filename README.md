## Deployed Application
[Visit our deployed page](https://chadoyek.github.io/Groove-Guide-Project-1/)


## Description
This deployment and initial build is to showcase how to discover new artists and their music based on my preferences (genre & popularity)


## Solved
1. We solved the responsive screen issue that was broken in the first build

2. Fixed the API which originally wasn't giving us any data

3. Fixed the slider and gave the user a second option to just type their numbers into the min and max section of the popularity section
